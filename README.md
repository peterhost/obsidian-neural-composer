## TL;DR

Chat with your vault using a **Knowledge Graph**, not just keyword search. Neural Composer runs a local [LightRAG](https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG) server, builds a graph of your notes, and lets you ask questions that trace connections across your entire vault.

- 🔍 **Finds relationships**, not just matching words
- ⚡ **Manages the LightRAG server** for you — no terminal juggling
- 🔒 **100% local** when used with Ollama — your data never leaves your machine

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+ · `pip install "lightrag-hku[api]"` · Obsidian 1.7.2+

## Features

| | |
|---|---|
| **⚡ Automated Server** | Starts and stops the LightRAG Python process automatically. No terminal needed. |
| **🧠 Graph + Vector Search** | Combines entity-relationship traversal with semantic vector search for deep, contextual answers. |
| **📂 Vault Sync** | Set a watched folder — notes are re-indexed on save. Status dots in the file explorer show each note's graph state: 🟢 processed · 🟡 processing · 🔴 failed · 🔵 removed. |
| **📊 Knowledge Graph View** | Explore your graph visually in 2D or 3D. Overview mode renders all nodes; Explore mode does a BFS walk from any entity. |
| **🌐 Remote Server** | Connect to a LightRAG instance on a NAS, VPS, or Docker container. |
| **🤖 MCP Tools** | Expose your graph to any MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, etc.). |
| **🔍 Source Transparency** | Every answer includes citations `[1]` linked to the exact notes and text chunks that were used. |
| **🔒 Local & Private** | Use Ollama for a fully offline setup, or any hosted provider you prefer. |

## Why Graph RAG?

Standard vector search finds *similar text*. Graph RAG finds *connected ideas*.

| | Standard Vector Search | Neural Composer (Graph RAG) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **How it works** | Finds chunks that match your query semantically | Traverses relationships between entities in your notes |
| **Best for** | "What is X?" | "How does X influence Y across my research?" |
| **Context quality** | Often fragmented | Holistic — sees the whole picture |
| **Multi-hop reasoning** | ✗ | ✓ |

## Getting Started

> 📖 Full documentation on the [Wiki](https://github.com/oscampo/obsidian-neural-composer/wiki)

### 1. Install the LightRAG backend

```bash
# Recommended: use a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install "lightrag-hku[api]"
```

Then find the path to the installed executable (you'll need it in Step 3):

```bash
which lightrag-server        # macOS / Linux
where.exe lightrag-server    # Windows
```

### 2. Install the Plugin

Search for **"Neural Composer"** in **Settings → Community Plugins → Browse** and enable it.

### 3. Connect & Configure

Open **Settings → Neural Composer**. The panel has a sidebar with seven tabs:

1. **Providers** — add your API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq, Ollama, etc.)
2. **Models** — select your chat, apply, and embedding models
3. **Graph & Vault** — set the `lightrag-server` path, choose a data directory, and optionally configure a **Watched Folder** for auto-sync
4. Toggle **Auto-start** on, then click **Restart Server**

A green dot in the status bar confirms the server is running. Right-click any folder in your vault to ingest notes and start chatting.

<summary>🛠️ Use Cases</summary>

- **Researchers** — synthesize arguments across hundreds of papers, surface consensus and contradictions that keyword search misses.
- **Writers & Game Masters** — track relationships between characters and lore; keep your world internally consistent without digging through folders.
- **Journalers** — connect entries from months ago to today, spotting patterns that aren't visible day-to-day.
- **Project Managers** — visualize dependencies between project notes that otherwise look like separate tasks.

<details>
<summary>🧩 Advanced Options</summary>

| Feature | Where to configure |
|:---|:---|
| **Watched Folder** | Settings → Graph & Vault → Watched folder |
| **Remote Server** | Settings → Graph & Vault → Use remote server |
| **Custom Ontology** | Settings → Graph & Vault → Ontology section — teach the graph domain-specific entity types (e.g. "Experiment", "Theorem") |
| **Reranking** | Settings → Graph & Vault → Reranking — Jina AI, Cohere, or a custom local endpoint |
| **MCP Servers** | Settings → Tools (MCP) |
| **Graph Visualization** | Settings → Graph & Vault → Graph rendering engine — 2D (fast) or 3D (immersive) |
| **Performance Tuning** | Settings → Advanced — chunk size, overlap, async workers |
| **Custom `.env` overrides** | Settings → Advanced — raw `.env` editor with full LightRAG configuration access |

<summary>🔒 Privacy & Security</summary>

Neural Composer is designed with privacy as a core principle.

### What leaves your machine

| Destination | When | Why |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Your AI provider** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq, etc.) | Every chat message or ingestion | To generate responses and embeddings. Only notes you explicitly ingest or attach are sent. |
| **Your local LightRAG server** (`localhost`) | Every query and ingestion | The plugin talks to a Python process on your own machine. No data leaves. |
| **Your remote LightRAG server** | Only if you configure a remote URL | Off by default. Opt-in only. |

**Using Ollama + local LightRAG = zero data leaves your machine.**

### What never happens

- The plugin does **not** send telemetry, analytics, or crash reports.
- The plugin does **not** contact `github.com` or any external domain at runtime. Links in the UI are navigation-only — never fetched programmatically.
- API keys are stored **only** in Obsidian's own `data.json` in your local vault.

### System-level access disclosures

<details>
<summary>Why the Obsidian scanner flags certain capabilities</summary>

| Capability | Reason |
|:---|:---|
| **`fs` (filesystem)** | Writes the LightRAG `.env` config file to your chosen work directory, which may be outside the vault. |
| **`child_process` (shell)** | Starts and stops the local LightRAG Python server. The command is always the exact path you configure — no user input is interpolated into shell arguments. |
| **Vault enumeration** | Lists file paths for ingestion and the search index. File content is only read when you explicitly ingest a file. |
| **Clipboard** | Inherited from the Lexical rich-text editor in the chat input. Standard paste operations only. |
| **`atob`/`btoa` (Base64)** | Used by bundled deps: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` decodes JWT tokens for MCP OAuth; `sigma`/`three-forcegraph` encode WebGL shader data. No sensitive data is encoded this way. |
| **`new Function`** | Used by two bundled libraries: `ngraph.forcelayout` (3D physics) and `ajv` (JSON schema validation via MCP SDK). Neither executes user-provided code. |
